<h1>Order Entry User's Guide</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This order entry system has the following major uses:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe the products we regularly carry.</li>
<li>Help us prepare and place orders for those products.</li>
<li>Receive shipments and price products.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Configuration and Setup</h2>
<p>
The system contains more information than just products and orders. It also contains
lists of vendors, contacts, product categories, product subcategories, and
brand names. All this information is entered through windows that may be accessed
under the "Setup" option on the main menu bar. Most of this information is entered
as part of initially setting up the system, but changes must still be made sometimes
using these same windows.
</p>
<h3>Using Grids For Data Entry</h3>
<p>
Many of the windows in this software use the same kind of grid for data entry.
There are several things it is helpful to know when using these grids.
</p>
<p>
First, the software doesn't save what you change on a row until you either close
the window containing the grid or click on a different row in the grid. At that point
it will also check what you've entered on the row to make sure it is valid, and give
you an error if it is not. You may find situations where things don't work as expected
because you haven't saved the current row of a grid yet, for example you can't use
a new product subcategory to create products because you haven't saved the new
subcategory.
</p>
<p>
Second, on some windows you may want to delete a line of the grid. For example,
you may want to delete a brand name that was entered by mistake. The way to do this
is to click on the very leftmost cell in the grid on that row, the little square one
with no text in it. That selects the entire row, as opposed to just one cell in the
row. Then you can delete the row by pressing the "Delete" key on the keyboard.
</p>
<p>
Some grids do not allow you to delete rows - the most common example is the grid
on the product details form. The only way to add or remove rows for an order is
to set the categories on the order list window. If you try to delete a row on a grid
that doesn't allow it you don't get an error, it simply does nothing.
</p>
<p>
Third, on grids that allow you to add rows you can do this by scrolling to the bottom
of the grid and clicking in any cell in the blank row at the bottom. There will be no
such blank row at the bottom if you aren't allowed to add a row on this grid.
</p>
<h2>Describing Products</h2>
<p>
Probably the most important set of information in the system is the list of products.
Each vendor has their own product list. The system is able to represent a single product
that is available through multiple vendors, but we have not yet made use of this feature.
You may see hints of this feature in naming conventions and a few options in the
user interface. For example, on the vendor products window you can enter both "retail"
and "vendor retail" prices. This just means that we can define a "normal" retail price
for a product ("retail"), and an alternate price that applies if we buy it through
this vendor ("vendor retail"). Several other pieces of information on the vendor
products window have dual values the same way.
</p>
<h3>Product List</h3>
<p>
The product list for each vendor is entered on the vendor products window, which is
listed under "Setup" on the main menu bar. On this window you can manage the product
list for one product category of one vendor at a time. You cannot see all products
for the vendor, just one product category. This is where you make price changes,
cost changes, name changes, etc.
</p>
<p>
For retail pricing, we generally only enter the price in the "Retail" column.
We leave "Vendor Retail" zero, which tells it to always use the "Retail" column.
</p>
<p>
Product cost (wholesale price) is either described as cost per item,
or cost for a case (or other quantity larger than one). Cost per item is entered
in the "Each Cost" column. Cost for a case, and the number of items in a case,
are entered in the "Case Cost" and "Case Size" columns.
</p>
<p>
Under normal circumstances, products will not appear on order sheets unless they
are noted as "Active" on the vendor products window. To be "Active" both the
"Product Active" and "V.P. Active" checkbox columns must be checked.
</p>
<p>
The other important vendor product columns are "Sub Category", "Product Name", "Size", 
and "Vendor Code". The size can be left blank, but the other three are required.
</p>
<h3>Adding Or Importing Products</h3>
<p>
You can manually type in new products one by one on the vendor products window,
by showing the products for that vendor and product category and then typing them
on the bottom row of the grid. This is the hard way of doing it, but it may be
the only way available.
</p>
<p>
If the product information is available in a spreadsheet, or on a web page,
it is probably possible to put that information in a form where it can be imported
into the software instead of re-typing it.
</p>
<p>
Importing is done by clicking "Import Products Using This Vendor" on the
vendor products window, which will display the "Import Products" window.
This window contains a large box where you can enter lines of text, each
defining one product to create. Each line contains ten pieces of information,
separated by tabs. The pieces are named in the column headings above the
input box, and also in some comments above it.
</p>
<p>
The information entered is pretty self-explanatory. The only subtlety is that
the names of the subcategories and brands must exactly match the names defined
in the software in order to be recognized. The product subcategory MUST be 
matched for the import to occur, but not the brand name. If the brand name is
not recognized it will ask you if you want to create that brand name. We do it
this way because new brand names happen all the time, but not new product 
subcategories.
</p>
<p>
Once the information is in the import products window, just click "Create Products".
</p>
<h3>Importing From Spreadsheets</h3>
<p>
The import products window is designed to be used by copying information from
spreadsheets. This is why the information is separated by tabs - that's how
spreadsheets format it when you cut and paste regions from them. So what we
suggest is to prepare the information in spreadsheets, and then cut and paste
it into the import products window.
</p>
<p>
Two columns in your spreadsheet probably need special handling to make data
entry easier - product brand and product subcategory. These columns should be
equipped with dropdown lists in the spreadsheet to avoid mistakes in data entry.
</p>
<p>
To add a dropdown list for a column takes several steps in Open Office Calc:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Enter the list
of possible values as a column in the spreadsheet. Normally you will create
a separate sheet in the spreadsheet to hold the subcategory and brand lists, and put each 
in a separate column in that sheet.</li>
<li>To make it easy to make these lists, I've created a spreadsheet "Lists.ods"
in "\\SUSANYAUKEY\dc\Public\2009 Vendor Inventory" that has the current
lists of brand names and subcategories. You can cut and paste from "Lists.ods".
If you add or change this information in
the software please update the copy in "Lists.ods" as well.</li>
<li>Select all the values in the copy of the list in your spreadsheet.</li>
<li>Assign a name to the selected region. Do this by typing
the name in the box where Open Office Calc shows the range you've selected,
and then pressing enter. For consistency, use the name "SubCats" for the
list of subcategories, and "Brands" for the list of brand names.</li>
<li>If you mess up assigning the name, you can remove
the name by clicking "Insert", "Names" and "Define" on the Open Office Calc
menu bar, then deleting the named range you messed up.</li>
<li>Click the top cell (NOT the column header) in the column where you want
to add a dropdown list.</li>
<li>Click "Data" and "Validity" on the menu bar. Select the "Criteria" tab.</li>
<li>Set "Allow" to "Cell Range", uncheck "Allow Blank Cells", check "Show Selection List"
and "Sort Entries Ascending", and set "Source" to the name of the range you defined
with the list of choices ("Brands" or "SubCats").</li>
<li>Select "Error Alert" tab. Check the "Show error message when invalid values
are entered" box, and set "Action" to "stop".</li>
<li>Click "OK".</li>
<li>The first cell in the column should now have a dropdown list.</li>
<li>Copy and paste that cell to the other cells in the column to give them
the same dropdown list.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Importing From Web Pages</h3>
<p>
If the product information you want to enter is on a web page somewhere, you
may be able to extract it from that web page with another feature of the software.
Once you extract it from the web page you will be able to paste that information
into a spreadsheet, and from there you can cut and paste it into the import
products window.
</p>
<p>
Under "Setup" on the main menu bar, click "Extract Vendor Products From Web".
</p>
<p>
The software will open another window, which is a stripped down version of
a Microsoft Internet Explorer window. All that's missing is the menu bar
and all the toolbars. We added our own minimalist set of navigation controls -
a box to type the URL of a web page into, a "Go" button to display that page,
and buttons to navigate forward and back through your history.
</p>
<p>
There are a bunch of controls at the bottom of the browser window to let you
extract information from the current web page. <b>NONE OF THESE DO ANYTHING
UNLESS THE "Extract Product Info" BOX IS CHECKED!</b> Once this box is checked,
clicking on text on the web page extracts that text to use it as a product name,
size, brand name, cost, etc.
</p>
<p>
Each type of information that can be extracted has its own text box at the
bottom of the window. The type of information that will be extracted when you
click in the page is denoted by which box is colored light blue. If you click
anywhere on the web page, the text you clicked on will be stored in the blue
box and the color of the original text will be changed so you can keep track
of what you've clicked on. Remember - clicking text has no effect unless you
first check the "Extract Product Info" box!
</p>
<p>
The software tries very hard to save you work by recognizing certain
things about the information you click on. When you click on the product
name or description, it looks for anything in that text that could be
a size or weight. If it finds it, it removes it from the product name
and stores it in the "Size" box. It also recognizes text like "ea" or "box"
or "case" in prices and sets the correct boxes below.
</p>
<p>
You will always extract text in the same order, which is the order of the
boxes at the bottom of the window. Just look at which box is blue to known
what you are extracting.
</p>
<p>
Once you extract all the information for a product, click the "Save Product"
button on the window. This will "complete" your product, and put on your
clipboard the list of products extracted from the current web page. The
information is in the same tab separated format used by the "Import Products"
window, but you'll probably want to paste it into a spreadsheet instead because
you'll need to massage the data a bit before it is ready to import. For example,
you'll probably need to add or change brand names, and you'll definitely need
to add product subcategories.
</p>
<p>
If you make a mistake clicking on information, just click the "Undo Selection"
button. You can click this as many times as you like, and it will keep rolling
back one more step each time.
</p>
<h2>Orders</h2>
<p>
All the options for working with orders are under the "Ordering" option on the
main menu bar.
</p>
<h3>The Order List</h3>
<p>
Click "Order List" to see a list of all orders, most recent first. It shows several
pieces of information associated with each order, including dates, the freight,
an invoice number, a discount percentage, terms, and general notes. Don't worry
if you can't enter all the information, most of it is just for your information.
</p>
<p>
For example, it doesn't matter if you enter the invoice number. If the vendor
typically splits up an order onto multiple invoices you can enter their
order number there instead.
</p>
<p>
The only information that is actually used for anything is the vendor, the order
date, and the freight amount. The order date is used to sort the order list window,
and the freight is included in the running order total at the bottom of the order
details window.
</p>
<h3>Creating Orders</h3>
<p>
To create a new order, open the order list window, scroll to the bottom of the
grid, click on the last row (the blank one), select a vendor, and then click
on a different row to save the new row.
</p>
<p>
When first created, an order has no products in it. If you open it there will
be no lines in it at all - so you can't even order anything. You'll know this
is the case when you click on the order in the order list window and see there
are no categories selected in the category list on the right.
</p>
<p>
So the first thing you'll probably do is choose which product categories
you want to work with on the order, and add products from those categories
to the order. To do this simply click on the order, and click on the categories
in the category list on the right that you want to include, and then click
"Set Order Categories". When you click that button it will add all the products
in those categories to your order. They'll all be zero quantity ordered, but
now they'll be on the order so you can change the quantity ordered.
</p>
<p>
When you click on an order in the order list window it always shows what categories
are in the order over on the right.
</p>
<p>
To remove product categories from an order, first click on that order in the order
list window. It will select the current categories. Just click on any of those
categories to un-select them in the list, and click "Set Order Categories".
Whenever you click this button it adds the categories that are currently selected,
and removes the ones that are unselected.
</p>
<p>
Note that it will not remove products from the order if any of the quantity columns
for that product are non-zero. So if you try to remove all product categories from
an order where you've entered a bunch of quantities, what you'll get is an order
with only the things you actually ordered.
</p>
<p>
The other subtle thing you can do with "Set Order Categories" is to add new products
to existing orders. If you add a product on the vendor products window, then click
"Set Order Categories" for an order that includes that category, the new product 
will be added to the order.
</p>
<h3>Viewing Orders and Changing Quantities</h3>
<p>
Once an order has the correct products in it, you can view all the lines and
modify the quantities by clicking on the order in the order list window and
then clicking the "Show Order Details" button.
</p>
<p>
This will open the "Order Details" window for that order. This window is mostly
a grid showing one product per line. Most of the columns show information from
the vendor products window, and can't be modified here. The only information
other than the grid is an order total at the bottom. This is the total cost
of the order, including shipping from the order list window. The total cost is
updated automatically as you change the numbers in the "Ordered" window and
then move do a different line in the order.
</p>
<p>
The columns you can
modify are mostly the quantities: "Ordered", "Received", "Back Ordered", "Missing",
"Damaged", and "On Hand". "Ordered" is the number you ordered, "Received" is how
many were actually shipped, "Back Ordered" is how many the <b>vendor</b> said
they backordered for you, "Missing" and "Damaged" is how many <b>you</b> decided were
missing or damaged, and "On Hand" is how many were on our shelf when you created the
order. The "On Hand" amount is just for your information, to help you decide how many to order.
</p>
<p>
All these quantities (except "On Hand") mean individual items if the "Eaches" box 
is checked for that line, otherwise they mean cases/boxes/packs/etc.
</p>
<h3>Other Useful Columns In Order Details</h3>
<p>
There are many, many columns on the order details window.
</p>
<p>
Two very interesting columns are the margins for regular retail price and the vendor retail
price. These are computed based on the actual cost that applies for the order. If you
ordered by eaches then it will use the standard vendor each cost, unless you entered a
non-zero amount in the "Special Each Cost" column. If you ordered by cases then it will
use the standard order case cost, unless you entered a non-zero amount in the "Special
Case Cost".
</p>
<h3>Printing and Faxing Orders</h3>
<p>
Whenever you like you can create several different printouts for the order.
All are done using buttons at the bottom of the Order Details window.
</p>
<p>
The "Purchase Order Fax" report shows the information you need to fax into the
vendor to place the order. It is intended to print and fax directly, instead
of transcribing the information onto another piece of information. It only
shows lines that have a non-zero quantity.
</p>
<p>
The "Order Worksheet" report shows ALL lines of the order, regardless of
quantities. It is intended to print out, take downstairs onto the sales
floor, and right the order quantities on. You can also add the amounts on
hand on it if you like. Then take the printout upstairs and enter the
amounts into the order on the order details window.
</p>
<p>
The "Order Check-In" report includes lines with quantities, showing all those
quantities and all pricing information. This is intended to be the sheet you
work off of to price an order as it comes in.
</p>
<h2>Pricing Products</h2>
<p>
The general procedure is to print the "Order Check-In" report for the order,
and compare the cost from the actual invoice to the cost we have in our
system. If the cost is the same, use the retail price on the "Order Check-In"
report.
</p>
<p>
If the cost is different, figure out the new retail price and write both the
new cost and retail price on the report.
</p>
<p>
When the order is done, take the check-in report to the computer and update
the vendor product list with the new costs and retail prices. <b>THIS IS VERY
IMPORTANT!</b> If we don't keep the product list up to date then it becomes
much more time consuming to create orders and process them when they arrive.
</p>
<p>
There are paper handling procedures documented elsewhere related to this
process - for example where to put all the printouts so the correct things
are done with them at the correct times.
